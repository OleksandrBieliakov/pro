The mobile app (native Android most likely) for splitting common costs.

E.g. you live with a girlfriend/boyfriend and both of you spend money on different things you both will use, like food, rent, things for home etc.
And you want your costs to be equal, so you need to keep track of them. Later you can see who owes to whom and pay back.
This works the same for roommates. Or in other situations. Like a trip with your friends where each of you pays for something and later you need to return money.

It will work like this:
	* you connect with your friend in the app creating a common balance 
	* each of you can add a new spending with a title and amount of money. And another person will get the notification and see it immediately in his/her app 
	* the total costs sum is updated as well as the balance, showing who owes whom 
	* you can add a photo of a receipt or other payment confirmation to the payment entry in the app, if you did not another person can request it 
	* you can have multiple such balances with different people and groups of people 
	* you can split costs in equal shares or set some custom shares 

Also, it would be very cool to implement some more complex things like:
	* using of some text recognition algorithm to parse data from a receipt and automatically create a new spending entry (there are probably some open source libraries for text recognition) 
	* implementing a possibility to pay back using the app:
		- you have some negative balance
		- you press the button "Pay back"
		- then the app will redirect you to a picked payment method to make the transfer, preparing some payment details for the actual banking site or application
		- after the payment is done the recipient is notified about it and needs to make a confirmation that he received the pay back
		- then you can close you balance or continue using it 
	* implementing some analytics:
		- each spending entry is assigned some category (automatically or manually), e.g. grocery, rent, entertainment etc.
		- then you can see what were your total spending for each category
		- we can also use some visualization like diagrams or pie charts
